# Tomorrow.io-assignment

Hey! this is the simple version to the home assignment.

to run the project:

in /server: 
1. npm i 
2. npm run api 

in /client/weather-app:
1. npm i
2. npm run dev (tried to re-script it to 'npm-start' but didn't work)
                       
                       
Had to rebuild the project 'from scratch' in react-vite since i had some weird issues when i ran the 'npm i' command in the cloned directory from the assignment's repository and didn't want to bother you guys on a weekend so I just decided to advance forward, hope you can see that as a good thing :)

Also, attached a video of the final version
